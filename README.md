A general-purpose 433MHz receiver shield for the Arduino Duemilanove
microcontroller and other boards based on the same header format, such
as the Seeeduino and the Arduino Pro.

Includes significant prototyping area using the spare shield area.

Note that this design uses 0603 surface-mount parts and is intended for
machine assembly, but could still be assembled by hand with a fine-tip
soldering iron, a steady hand, and some magnification.

Features:

 * Reset button wired through to Arduino reset pin.
 * Two general-purpose surface-mount LEDs wired to GND via current-
   limiting resistors (drive HIGH to illuminate).
 * Pads for 2 surface-mount 100nF smoothing capacitors.
 * Parts overlay on both the top and the bottom so you can see what you
   are connecting without turning the board over.
